# Data-Science-Portfolio
A track record of my technical data science skills through solving real-world problems using data.

Machine Learning Project :
Projects that I completed  in a team through building Machine Learning models that are used to solve a real-world problem.The projects completed follow the sequence of Exploratory Data Analysis > Pre-Processing > Modelling > Model deployment using Flask/Streamlit

Coding Challenges:
Coding excercises that i completed to refine my technical data science skills using Python. 

Data Analytics:
This is an extension of the Machine Learning projects that solely focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (This is found in the machine learning projects as well), however the cental focus is on extracting insights from excel speedsheets through Microsoft Power BI.
